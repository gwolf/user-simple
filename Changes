Revision history for Perl extension User::Simple.

1.0  Sun Aug 21 23:06:08 2005
        - Now correctly works with any kind of DBD backend
	- Added a complete test suite, which surprisingly worked!

0.9  Sat Jul 30 10:45:15 2005
	- Added Date::Calc and Digest::MD5 as prerequisite modules
        - Added a more granular 'level' for the users instead of the 
	  all-or-nothing is_admin infrastructure
	- Modified the is_admin infrastructure so old code works
	  seamlessly with the new version (although sends out some
	  warnings, as is_admin is officially deprecated)
        - Added/clarified some documentation

0.8  Wed Jun 15 10:52:29 2005
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-X User::Simple
