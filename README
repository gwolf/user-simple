User::Simple - Simple user sessions management

User::Simple provides a very simple framework for validating users,
managing their sessions and storing a minimal set of information (this
is, a meaningful user login/password pair and the user's name) via a
database. The sessions can be used as identifiers for i.e. cookies on
a Web system. The passwords are stored as MD5 hashes (this means, the
password is not stored in clear text). 

User::Simple includes User::Simple::Admin, which provides the basic
functionalities to manage the users.

User::Simple was originally developed with a PostgreSQL database in
mind, but should work with any DBD.
